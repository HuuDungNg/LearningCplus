# Basic C++ Syntax

Welcome to the Basic C++ Syntax section! This guide will introduce you to the fundamental building blocks of C++ programming. By the end of this section, you'll be familiar with the structure of a C++ program, data types, variables, operators, and how to handle input and output.

## 1. Structure of a C++ Program

A typical C++ program consists of several key components. These include preprocessor directives, the main function, and various statements that perform actions. Understanding the structure of a program is essential for writing and reading C++ code effectively.

- **Preprocessor Directives:** Instructions that are processed before the compilation of the program begins, such as `#include`.
- **Main Function:** The entry point of every C++ program, usually written as `int main() { ... }`.
- **Statements:** Individual instructions that perform operations, such as `std::cout << "Hello, World!";`.

## 2. C++ Data Types

C++ supports a variety of data types that define the nature of data that can be stored and manipulated within a program. These include:

- **`int`:** Represents integer numbers.
- **`float`:** Represents floating-point numbers with single precision.
- **`double`:** Represents floating-point numbers with double precision.
- **`char`:** Represents individual characters.
- **`bool`:** Represents boolean values (`true` or `false`).

## 3. Variables and Constants

Variables are used to store data that can change throughout the execution of a program, while constants hold data that remains unchanged.

- **Variables:** Declared with a specific data type, and their values can be modified.
- **Constants:** Declared using the `const` keyword, and their values cannot be altered once set.

## 4. Operators

Operators in C++ are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. They are categorized into several types:

- **Arithmetic Operators:** Perform mathematical operations like addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- **Relational Operators:** Compare values, such as `==` (equal to) and `>` (greater than).
- **Logical Operators:** Perform logical operations, such as `&&` (AND) and `||` (OR).
- **Bitwise Operators:** Perform operations on binary representations of integers, like `&` (AND) and `|` (OR).
- **Assignment Operators:** Assign values to variables, such as `=` and `+=`.

## 5. Input and Output in C++

C++ uses the `iostream` library for input and output operations. The most common methods are:

- **`cout`:** Used to output (print) data to the console.
- **`cin`:** Used to read (input) data from the console.
